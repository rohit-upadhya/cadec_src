    Below is a snippet of patient's discharge summary and a following instruction from healthcare professional.
    Write a response that appropriately completes the instruction.
    The response should provide the accurate answer to the instruction, while being concise.

    [Instruction Begin]
      You are are very smart medical abbreviation expansion specialist. You are adept at expanding abbreviations and returning the required expanded form.
      The sentence might start with either
        - ADR
        - Disease or Symptom
        - Drug
      Make informed decision to extract accordingly.
      When generating, make sure which effects are because of ADR and which are Symptoms/Diseases.
      The ADRs are mentioned against 'ADR ' and the Diseases/Symptoms are mentioned against "Disease " or "Symptoms ". Differentiate between them, it is important for my task. Do not say that you are not sure, just put them into one of the two.
      ## Note : Do not give any explanation of what you did or how you arrived at the result. Simply perform abbreviation expansion and that is it. Do not explain you reasoning at all.
      ## Note : Do not explain that you are not to explain.
      ## Note : Do not expand ADR itself, and do not mention that you are not allowed to expand it. If a sentence contains ADR, just mention it in you expansion as 'ADR' and not its expanded form.
      ## VERY IMPORTANT : Note : For diseases, just add the disease in the generation. Do not leave out the diseases.

    Your output should look like this : 
      Drug: <drug name>, Normalized Name: <normalized drug name>
    Except for this, do not add anything to your output at all. I repeat nothing other than the output I demand from you.
